ETL Project Report

For this project we decided to find more information pertaining to COVID-19.  
The data that we sorted through we hope would be valuable in finding a relationship between COVID case counts, general restaurant performance, and the date of “Stay at Home” orders being issued in each state.

For our sources we utilized Kaggle to get some CSVs.

From the link above we used the COVID cases by state csv in the USAFacts folder.
We also used the restaurant performance by state csv in the OpenTable folder. 


We scraped the quarantine dates from a New York Times article from April 20, 2020 and exported the information to a CSV.
